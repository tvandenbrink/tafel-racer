# TafelRaceGame Improvements Summary

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Fixed Collision Logic
- **Issue**: Multiple collisions from same obstacle could cause multiple life losses
- **Solution**: Added collision deduplication using `lastCollisionTime` state
- **Implementation**: 500ms cooldown between collisions, obstacles are removed after hit
- **Result**: Each obstacle can only cause 1 life loss

### 2. Dynamic Game Configuration
- **Updated GameLogic**: Now uses dynamic `carSpeed` and `blockStartZ` values instead of constants
- **Settings Integration**: All game elements now respond to user-configured speed and timing
- **Responsive Gameplay**: Game difficulty scales with user settings

### 3. Enhanced UI & Debug Features
- **Debug Panel**: Shows real-time game state (speed, timing, obstacle count, collision info)
- **Invincibility Indicator**: Visual feedback when player is invincible after collision
- **Improved Settings**: Better slider controls with real-time value display

### 4. Code Architecture Improvements
- **Single GameLogic Component**: Removed duplicate GameLogic rendering
- **Dynamic Values**: All hard-coded values now use calculated/configurable alternatives
- **Better State Management**: Added `lastCollisionTime` for collision deduplication

### 5. Visual Enhancements
- **Large Text**: Answer gates use 180px font size (5x increase from original 36px)
- **Pulse Animation**: Invincibility indicator has smooth pulsing effect
- **Better Debug Info**: Monospace font and structured layout for development info

## ðŸŽ® Game Balance
- **Speed Range**: 0.02 - 0.2 (20-200 in UI)
- **Gate Timing**: 2-8 seconds between question gates
- **Obstacle Safety**: Basic implementation (can be enhanced with more sophisticated timing)
- **Collision Cooldown**: 500ms between hits to prevent spam damage

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details
- **Framework**: React + Three.js (React Three Fiber)
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development
- **Collision Detection**: Z-axis proximity + lane matching
- **State Management**: React hooks with proper dependency arrays
- **Performance**: Efficient `useFrame` hook usage within Canvas context

## ðŸš€ Ready for Testing
The game now runs on `http://localhost:3003` with all improvements active. Test scenarios:
1. **Collision System**: Hit obstacles - should only lose 1 life per obstacle
2. **Settings**: Adjust speed/timing - game should respond immediately
3. **Visual Feedback**: Invincibility state should be clearly visible
4. **Performance**: Smooth gameplay at various speed settings
